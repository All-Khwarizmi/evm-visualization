An interactive visualization tool for understanding the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution process.

## Overview

EVM Visualizer is a web-based educational tool designed to help developers, students, and blockchain enthusiasts understand how the Ethereum Virtual Machine works. Through interactive visualizations, it demonstrates the execution flow of smart contracts, showing how transactions are processed, how data moves between different components, and how state changes occur.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: See how transactions flow through the EVM with real-time, interactive visualizations
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Walk through EVM operations one instruction at a time to understand the execution flow
- **Component Breakdown**: Visualize key EVM components including Stack, Memory, Storage, and World State
- **Opcode Exploration**: Learn about different EVM opcodes and their effects on the execution environment
- **Gas Monitoring**: Understand how gas is consumed during contract execution
- **Custom Scenarios**: Create, import, and export custom EVM execution scenarios
- **Community Contributions**: Access a library of community-contributed scenarios for various use cases
- **Dark Mode Support**: Comfortable viewing experience in different lighting conditions

## Creating Custom Scenarios

EVM Visualizer allows you to create custom execution scenarios to visualize specific transactions or smart contract interactions. You can:

1. Use the built-in Scenario Builder UI
2. Create scenarios manually as JSON files
3. Import and export scenarios for sharing
